=============================================
Chaos (LongTurn Chaos) Ruleset for Freeciv 21
=============================================

The goal of Chaos is to try out completely unrealistic, totally insane ideas, 
and see how much fun we can have in the ensuing chaos. It is a game-mode where 
anything can happen for no reason. It will not be fair, it will not be 
balanced, and it will not be predictable. This is not one for the faint of 
heart, you have been warned!

Features:
---------

- Impetuous Units:

  - Units with moves remaining may automatically attack enemy units that move
    next to them and the unit deems it favourable to attack rather than allow
    themselves to be attacked.

  - A random selection of unit types will provoke units that they move 
    adjacent to into attacking them regardless of whether it is more favourable
    to defend against the attack or not.

- Inaccessible Climates:

  - All cities get 1 pollution by default.

  - Pollution adds to global warming 5.0x faster.

  - Pollution no longer halves tile output, but instead increases shield
    output by 1.

  - Global warming and nuclear winter cause terrain to become inaccessible, 
    and inaccessible terrain to transform into a different accessible terrain.

- Explosive Expansion:

  - Manhattan project has been removed - Nukes are enabled from the start.
  
  - Settlers can sacrifice themselves in a nuclear detonation.
  
  - Settlers levitate, moving slowly over any terrain including open water.
  
  - Settlers can't use roads, boats, or airlift, and only move 1 tile per turn.
  
  - Settlers receive no defensive bonuses, and are very vulnerable to attack
    from ground, air, or sea.

- Blind World:

  - Cities, bases and most units have 0 vision radius

  - Explorer, Spy, and Patrol type units have 2 vision radius

  - Submarine type units have 1 vision radius

  - Aerial surveillance units have 5 vision radius
